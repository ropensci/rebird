\title{Recent observations at a region}
\usage{
ebirdregion(region, species = NULL, regtype = NULL, back = NULL,
  max = NULL, locale = NULL, provisional = FALSE, hotspot = FALSE,
  sleep = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{region}{(required) Region code corresponding to selected region type.
For supported region and coding, see
https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird-1.1-RegionCodeReference}

\item{species}{eBird species code. See \code{\link{ebirdtaxonomy}} for a full
list of scientific names, common names, and species codes. 
Defaults to NULL, in which case sightings for all species are returned.
See eBird taxonomy for more information:
http://ebird.org/content/ebird/about/ebird-taxonomy}

\item{regtype}{Region type you are interested in. can be "country"
(e.g. "US"), "subnational1" (states/provinces, e.g. "US-NV") or
"subnational" (counties, not yet implemented, e.g. "US-NY-109"). Default
behavior is to try and match according to the region specified.}

\item{back}{Number of days back to look for observations (between
1 and 30, defaults to 14).}

\item{max}{Maximum number of result rows to return in this request
(between 1 and 10000, defaults to all)}

\item{locale}{Language/locale of response (when translations are available).
See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html
(defaults to en_US)}

\item{provisional}{Should flagged records that have not been reviewed
be included? (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{hotspot}{Should results be limited to sightings at birding hotspots?
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{sleep}{Time (in seconds) before function sends API call (defaults to
zero.  Set to higher number if you are using this function in a loop with
many API calls).}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \code{\link[httr]{GET}}}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the collected information:

"comName": species common name

"howMany": number of individuals observed, NA if only presence was noted

"lat": latitude of the location

"lng": longitude of the location

"locID": unique identifier for the location

"locName": location name

"locationPrivate": TRUE if location is not a birding hotspot

"obsDt": observation date formatted according to ISO 8601
   (e.g. 'YYYY-MM-DD', or 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm'). Hours and minutes are excluded
   if the observer did not report an observation time.

"obsReviewed": TRUE if observation has been reviewed, FALSE otherwise

"obsValid": TRUE if observation has been deemed valid by either the
   automatic filters or a regional viewer, FALSE otherwise

"sciName" species' scientific name
}
\description{
Returns the most recent sighting information reported in a given region.
