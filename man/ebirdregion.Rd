\title{Recent observations at a region or hotspot}
\usage{
ebirdregion(
  loc,
  species = NULL,
  back = NULL,
  max = NULL,
  locale = NULL,
  provisional = FALSE,
  hotspot = FALSE,
  simple = TRUE,
  sleep = 0,
  key = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{(required) Region code or locID (for hotspots). Region code can
be country code (e.g. "US"), subnational1 (states/provinces, e.g. "US-NV"), or
subnational2 code (counties, e.g. "CA-BC-GV").}

\item{species}{eBird species code. See \code{\link{ebirdtaxonomy}} for a full
list of scientific names, common names, and species codes. Alternatively, 
you can wrap the scientific name in the \code{\link{species_code}} function 
which will return the eBird species code.
Defaults to NULL, in which case sightings for all species are returned.
See eBird taxonomy for more information:
https://ebird.org/science/use-ebird-data/the-ebird-taxonomy}

\item{back}{Number of days back to look for observations (between
1 and 30, defaults to 14).}

\item{max}{Maximum number of result rows to return in this request
(between 1 and 10000, defaults to all)}

\item{locale}{Language/locale of response (when translations are available).
See \url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html} and 
\url{https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000804865-bird-names-in-ebird} 
(defaults to en_US).}

\item{provisional}{Should flagged records that have not been reviewed
be included? (defaults to FALSE)}

\item{hotspot}{Should results be limited to sightings at birding hotspots?
(defaults to FALSE).}

\item{simple}{Logical. Whether to return a simple (TRUE, default) or detailed
(FALSE) set of results fields. Detailed results are only available if 
\code{loc} is a locID.}

\item{sleep}{Time (in seconds) before function sends API call (defaults to
zero.  Set to higher number if you are using this function in a loop with
many API calls).}

\item{key}{eBird API key. You can obtain one from https://ebird.org/api/keygen.
We strongly recommend storing it in your \code{.Renviron} file as an 
environment variable called \code{EBIRD_KEY} to avoid having to constantly 
supply the key, and to avoid accidentally sharing it publicly.}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \code{\link[httr]{GET}}}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the collected information:

"speciesCode": species code

"comName": species common name

"sciName" species' scientific name

"locID": unique identifier for the location

"locName": location name

"obsDt": observation date formatted according to ISO 8601
   (e.g. 'YYYY-MM-DD', or 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm'). Hours and minutes are excluded
   if the observer did not report an observation time.

"howMany": number of individuals observed, NA if only presence was noted

"lat": latitude of the location

"lng": longitude of the location

"obsValid": TRUE if observation has been deemed valid by either the
   automatic filters or a regional viewer, FALSE otherwise

"obsReviewed": TRUE if observation has been reviewed, FALSE otherwise

"locationPrivate": TRUE if location is not a birding hotspot

"subId": submission ID
}
