This package is part of a richer suite called [spocc - Species Occurrence Data](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc), along with several other packages, that provide access to occurrence records from multiple databases. We recommend using `spocc` as the primary R interface to `rebird` unless your needs are limited to this single source.
